You may provide it with a sqlite3 database which contains the word and then it retrieves the meaning for you.
I may make it better but it is totally fine now for me.

It does some spell checking from now on this is the mechanism:

if the word is not in the standard dictionary then it checks using ispell
if it can find the root of the word(e.g create for creations) then brings the meaning of that back
but if it can not then tries the best nearest word to that.
if all this fails we dump a google search for the word and using some creepy nasty word processing bring the suggestion
out and use it .
It may probably won't work for double word combinations or things that google response is one character different than what i thought
would be. I can't do nothing for it ;)

And the list of lookups is stored in a history file, so that when you look up a word more than on time it warns you.
